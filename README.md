# Wireless-Com-Selection-Combining

Selection Combination (SC) is known as one of the receiver diversity techniques. The strongest signal is chosen from among the signals in SC. In other words, using the same channel with different antennas in the same branch as SC, the highest signal-to-noise ratio is selected among the signals and thus the obtained signal is optimized.

# Implementation
First of all, all the necessary parameters are defined. After that I set two for loops that iterate over SNR and M. In the for loops, there is an if-else structure that controls the value of M. If M is either 1, 3, 6 or 9, the if-else structure is activated. Except for M=1, since there is only one branch and one channel for M=1, Rayleigh coefficients are calculated separately. After that, related received powers which include path loss, the effect of shadowing and Rayleigh fading are calculated. After that within these received powers, the one which has the maximum average is selected and indicated as the one that will be used as Selective Combining received power. After that noise is calculated. Then noise is added to the signal and these added versions of the signal are sent to QPSK Demudolator. Lastly, the bit error rate (BER) is calculated.
